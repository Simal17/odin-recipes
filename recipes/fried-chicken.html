        <p>
            Korean fried chicken is one of my favorite dishes simply because it is crunchy and tasteful.
            This recipe features the most basic and standard korean fried chicken, however, there are 
            many many more variations or sauces that you can add to it.

            <li>Whisk cornstarch, flour, sugar, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, and 1/4 teaspoon salt together in a large bowl. Gradually whisk ice water into flour in until mixture resembles a smooth pancake batter. Transfer chicken to batter and stir to coat chicken completely.            </li>
            <li>Working in batches, cook chicken in preheated oil for 4 minutes. Transfer cooked chicken to a cooling rack.</li>
